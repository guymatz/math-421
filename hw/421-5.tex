\begin{enumerate}[label={\fbox{\textbf{Exercise \#\arabic* :}}}]

\item Prove the following
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If $c \in \Rb$, then the constant function $f(x) =c$ is continuous at every real number.

%        \underline{Scratch:}
%          \begin{align*}
%            |f(x) - f(c)| &= |c - c| \\
%                          &= 0 \\
%                          &\leq \epsilon
%          \end{align*}
           So we set $\delta = 5$
        \begin{proof}[Proof of (a)]

          Let $\epsilon>0$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$.  Take $\delta = 5$.
          Then for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ where $|x-c| < \delta$,
            \[ |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon \]

        \end{proof}
      \item The function $f(x) = x$ is continuous at every real number.

%        \underline{Scratch:}
%          \begin{align*}
%            |f(x) - f(c)| &= |x - c| \\
%                          &\leq \epsilon
%          \end{align*}
          So we set $\delta = \epsilon$
        \begin{proof}[Proof of (b)]
          Let $\epsilon>0$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$.  Take $\delta = \epsilon$.
          Then for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ where $|x-c| < \delta$,
            \[ |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon \]

        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}

\item Prove the following
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $n$ is a natural number, then the function $f(x) = x^n$ is
      continuous at every real number.

        \begin{proof}[Proof of (a)]
          Let $g_i(x) = x, i \in \{1\dots n\}$.  Then
            \[ f(x) = g_1(x) \cdot g_2(x) \dots g_n(x) = x^n \]
            By Exercise 1b, we know that $g_i(x)$ is continuous, and 
            by theorems shown in class, we 
            know that the multiplying continuous functions yields a 
            continuous function.
        \end{proof}

    \item If $g$ is a polynomial, then $g$ is continuous at every real number.
        \begin{proof}[Proof of (b)]
          \emph{A polynomial is "an expression which is composed of variables,
          constants and exponents, that are combined using mathematical
          operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and
        division (No division operation by a variable)."}

          With this definition in mind we can see that what we have
          shown in Exercise 2a, above, shows us that a specific polynomial
          is continuous.  Using the logic above we can also see that 
          since the addition and subtraction of continuous functions yields
          a continuous function.  The same can be said for multiplication
          by constants.
        \end{proof}

    \item If $h$ is a rational function, then $h$ is continuous at every number in its domain.

        \emph{A rational function is "any function that can be defined by a rational fraction, which is an algebraic fraction such that both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials. The coefficients of the polynomials need not be rational numbers"} 

        \begin{proof}[Proof of (c)]
          With this definition in mind we can see that what we have
          shown in Exercise 2b, above, shows us that any polynomial is
          continuous.  By Theorem 6.1 we know that the division on a
          continuous function by another continuous function, not equal
          to 0, is a continuous function.
        \end{proof}
  \end{enumerate}



\newpage
\item Spivak, Chapter 6, Problem 3 (a)
  Suppose that $f$ i s a function satisfying $|f(x)| \leq |x|$
  for all $x$. Show that $f$ is continuous at $0$. (Notice that $f(0)$
  must equal 0.)

%    \underline{Scratch:}
%      \begin{align*}
%        ||f(x)| - |f(c)|| &= ||x| - |c|| \\
%                          &\leq ||x|| - ||c|| \\
%                          &= |x| - |c|
%      \end{align*}

\begin{proof}
      So we set $\delta = \epsilon$

      We see that $\lim f(x) \leq lim |x|$, and
      $\lim_{x \to 0} |f(x)| = \lim_{x \to 0} |x| = 0$

      Since $|f(x)| \leq |x|$, for $x=0$ we have
      \[ 0 \leq |f(0)| \leq 0 \]
      so $f(0) = 0$

      So we fix $\epsilon > 0$ , and we have $c \in \mathbb{R}$.  Take
      $\delta = \epsilon$.  Then $\forall \in \mathbb{R}$, where $|x-0| < \delta$,
      \[ |f(x) - (0)| = |f(x)| \leq |x| < \delta = \epsilon \]

\end{proof}


\newpage
\item Spivak, Chapter 6, Problem 10 (a)
  Given a function, let $\abs{f}$ be the function defined by
  $\abs{f}(x) = \abs{f(x)}$. Prove: if $f$ is continuous at $a$, then
  $\abs{f}$ is continuous at $a$.

\begin{proof}
  By Homework 4, Ex 6 we know that $|f|$ is continuous .  And by Ex 3 above
  we know that if $|f(x)|$ is continuous at a point $a$. then $|f(x)|$
  is continuous at the point $a$.
\end{proof}


\newpage
\item Consider the function
$$f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if $x$ is irrational} \\
1 & \text{if $x$ is rational.}
\end{cases}
$$
Using the $\epsilon/\delta$ definition, prove that $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)$ does not exist for every real number $a$ (and hence $f$ is discontinuous at every real number).

  \renewcommand\qedsymbol{\Lightning}
  \begin{proof}[\textbf{Proof by contradiction}]  Towards a contradiction,
    let's assume that a limit exists.  In this case, $f(x)$ is continuous
    at a point $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $f(q) = 1$, so the 
    $\lim_{x \to q} f(x) = 1$.
    By the continuity of $f$, $\exists \delta >0, a \in \mathbb{R}$
    such that
      \[ |x-q| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(q)| < \epsilon \]
    Take $\delta = 3$.  Then we would like to be able to say that 
    $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$
    \[ |x-q| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(q)| = 1 -1 =0 \]
      However, by Theorem 1, there exists an irrational number
      $i \in (q - \delta, q + \delta)$ where $|f(x) - f(i)| = 1 - 0 =1$
      So the limit does not exist.
  \end{proof}

\newpage
\item Prove: if $f$ is continuous at $x=1$ and $f(1) = 7$,
then
$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow 4} f(8x-31) = 7.
$$

\begin{proof}[Proof: Using Theorem]

  \[ g(x) = 8x - 31 \]
    By Exercise 2a above, $g$ is continuous at $x=4$.  $g(4) = 1$, and
    we know that $f$ is continuous at 1, so $f$ 
    is continuous at $g(4)$.  Hence $f \circ g$ is continuous at 4 by
    theorem, which implies that
    \begin{align*}
      \lim_{x \to 4} f\circ g(x) &= f\circ g(4) \\
                            &= f(g(4)) \\
                            &= f(1) \\
                            &= 7 \\
                            &\implies \lim_{x \to 4} f(8x-31) = 7
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof: Using $\epsilon / \delta$]

    Fix $\epsilon > 0$.  By continuity of $f(1), \exists \delta >0$
    such that 
    \[ |y-1| < \delta_1 \implies |f(y) - f(1)| < \epsilon \]
    \underline{New Goal: } Find $\delta > 0$ such that
      \[ |x-4|< \delta \implies |8x-31 - 1| < \delta_1 \]
      Now $|8x - 31 - 1| = |8x - 32| = 8|x-4|$

      So if $\delta = \frac{\delta_1}{8}$, then
      $|x-4| < \frac{\delta_1}{8} =  \delta$
      Which implies
      \[ |8x - 31- 1| < \delta_1 \]
      And so we have
        \[ |f(8x-31)-7| <\epsilon \text{ if } |x-4| < \frac{\delta_1}{8} \]
\end{proof}

\newpage
\item Prove: if $f$ is continuous at $x=1$ and $f(1) = 7$,
then
$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow 4} f(x^2-x-11) = 7.
$$

\begin{proof}
  Let $g(x) = x^2 -x-11$.  By 2b above we know that any polynomial is
  continuous, so $g(x)$ is continuous.  Specifically, $g$ is continuous at
  $x=1$.  We know that $f$ is continuous at 1, by assumption.  Since\\
  $g(4) = 16 - 4 - 11 = 1$, $f \circ g$ is continuous at $x=1$ by theorem,
  which implies that
    \begin{align*}
      \lim_{x \to 4} f \circ g &= f \circ g(4) \\
                        &= f(g(4))\\
                        &= f(1)\\
                        &= 7\\
                        \implies& \lim_{x \to 4} f \circ g(x) = 7
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\newpage

\item \underline{Optional} Suppose that $f$ is a continuous function on $(a,b)$ and 
  \[lim _{x\rightarrow a^{+}}= lim_{x\rightarrow b^{-}}=\infty \]
  Prove that $f$ has a minimum on all of $(a,b)$, i.e there exists
 $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f(c) \leq f(x)$ for all $x\in (a,b)$.

\begin{proof} (Hint: Try to use the fact that a continuous function on a
  closed interval has a minimum.)

\end{proof}
